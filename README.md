MangoAPI
===============

MangoAPI facilitates developers to develop mobile and web applications without having to think about the backend. It treats
all entities as objects and their relationships as connections.

The name is derived from an Urdu idiom "aam khao ghutliyoon ka kiya karna", which translates literally to eat the mangoes, who cares about the seed.

The API is developed using Lithium Framework (PHP) over MongoDB

Basics:

	Create:
	
		URL:				api/index/

		requestJsonString:	{
		
								...
								
							}
						
	Retrieve:
	
		URL:				api/index/<id>
		
	Update:
	
		URL: 				api/index/<id>
		
		requestJsonString:	{
		
								...
								
							}
							
	Create a connection:
	
		URL:				api/index/<id>/<connection>
		
		requestJsonString:	{
		
								...
								
							}
